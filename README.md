## What it is

_vSongBook_ (Virtual Songbook) is a high quality, visual, open source tool to give users access to song lyrics of major worship and praise songbooks used in christian gatherings be it in church, weddings, funerals or anywhere where one feels like singing.

Controls and wizards are available for users to:

* Browse, edit, add, and delete songs
* Search songs realtime
* Adjust font types and sizes among other display preferences
* View songs in presentation mode for use over projector.

## What it is not

This program is not a media player tool, and does teach you how to sing some of the songs it comes with. It is a tool to be used by anyone who knows the songs contained in it and must remain as simple to use as possible in order to achieve these goals.

## History

This program was originally developed for Android devices 
[as an app](https://github.com/Appsmata/vSongAndy). It was first 
conceived and developed in September 2014 by Jackson Siro
([@Jacksiroke](https://github.com/Jacksiroke)) to solve his own problem of having to 
carry around songbooks to church and wherever he went and needed to sing a 
song since he already had the bible app on his smartphone. By then he was a 
student at KTTC undertaking a diploma course in ICT. While at home
during December the same year his father who came to his room to ask a 
computer questions noticed the app on Jack's phone and he asked that he 
be sent too the app to his phone. The happy father went to share the app
Jack's elder brother and while at the End of Year Meetings at Mbale, 
Kenya he endosed it there during one of his sermons. 

Later on in mid 2015 Kevin Ngalonde, an Android Developer from Zimbabwe,
agreed to host the app on his playstore account. Mid 2016 was when 
Jack was able to host the app in his own PlayStore Account. The app 
has been increasing getting updates and reviews over time and there 
was need to have it for desktop computers.

The first attempt to do a desktop for vSongBook was in late 2015 
using Visual Basic 6.0 and Microsoft Access Database 2010 which is 
[available on github also](https://github.com/JacksiroKe/vSongVB).
Later on as Jacksiro kept on improving his programming skills he ported
the app to Vb.net (c#) and that too is 
[available on github](https://github.com/JacksiroKe/vSongWin). 
A Windows Phone version is
[available on github](https://github.com/JacksiroKe/vSongWinfon).

It is in mid 2018 that Jacksiro began to port the desktop app to c++.
It was not easy for him because it until May 2019 that he was able to come
up with something that he could show to the public. He has been able 
so far to release the app in Sep 2019 using wxWidgets which he is now 
abandonding under the branch wxbuilds to use Qt Api.
